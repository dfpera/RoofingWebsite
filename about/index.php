                    <p>Chris Fraser started his Edmonton roof repair company more than 14 years ago.  Chris and wife Jackie have a large family by today’s standards (five children) and their goal was to build a future for perhaps a couple of their kids.  Back in the days when their children were starting to get expensive and competing for mom’s attention, a decision was made to keep mom at home &hellip; the day they decided to start their Edmonton roofing company &hellip; XL Roofing &hellip; the year was 1996 and they have never looked back!</p>
