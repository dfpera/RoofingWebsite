                <p>Hi Chris,</p>
                <p>I am writing to communicate my satisfaction, if not my elation, regarding the work and process of XL Roofing regarding the replacement of my mothers leaking garage roof.</p>
                <p>XL Roofing, specifically Chris Fraser, repaired my elderly mothers roof in the early winter of 2014. The important points:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I sent an email to Chris regarding the job, he replied within 45 minutes of my inquiry, agreed to go to the house by that afternoon to assess the job, and was there when he said he would be, very important when dealing with the elderly!</li>
                    <li>I was given a quote and although he and his crew did more work then what the quote was for, he charged exactly what the quote was given for.  No surprises.</li>
                    <li>As that I live on the other side of the country, it was a huge relief to find a roofer that would a) show up when he said he would, not common in Edmonton I found, and b) a roofer that carried out quality work without taking advantage of a pensioner</li>
                    <li>Regardless of the weather, the job was done when all other roofers wouldn't touch it.  After one of the worst winters Edmonton has seen in some time, even with the early snowfall, the job was completed in the worst conditions.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I would highly recommend XL Roofing in every way.  Thank you for all you have done.</p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>

                <p>Re:  Customer Satisfaction with job well done by Chris Fraser of XL Roofing</p>
                <p>Our roof badly needed re-doing!  From the process of getting a price to getting the job completed, Chris proved to be an easy fellow to work with.  He was quick to return calls and was always a hard-working pleasant person leading his crew of roofers working on our house.</p>
                <p>We remember that one of the first nights of the job, Chris came by around 8:30 to check the roof to ensure everything was in a fine state, as we were “expecting a bit of weather”.  He wanted to make sure his guys had left things just right. We appreciated that extra effort.</p>
                <p>Chris led a team of three roofers, and while he didn’t have to be present all day every day to ensure stuff was getting done right, he was around the site a lot. In his absence, his crew worked hard and well.  The guys kept the site clean of debris, as well as clean in terms of language and behaviour – meeting a great standard of professionalism, particularly in light of our four young kids watching them at work.</p>
                <p>In summary, we really appreciated Chris and his team’s hard work to get our roof re-done.  They were diligent and unobtrusive, reflecting Chris’ good leadership.</p>
                <p>Job well done!  Thanks Chris &amp; XL Roofing.</p>

                <p>After discovering a damaged area of 100 sq feet on my tar and gravel roof and not being able to find anyone willing to do the job I was finally referred to Chris of XL roofing.</p>
                <p>When I made initial contact with Chris, we made an appointment for an appraisal, Chris showed up right on time. He did a thorough examination on my roof noting small areas on my roof that needed to be addressed soon or they would turn into bigger problems. He gave me a quote which I found to be reasonable given the task at hand.</p>
                <p>Chris told me he could start the job in about 10 days. He was able to start a few days earlier than expected and got the job done in 1 day and the roof looked perfect. I could not tell where the damage had been.</p>
                <p>I found Chris to be very professional and willing to explain the process of the repair and answer any questions I had.</p>
                <p>I was very happy to finally be able to find a company willing to do a project that wasn't "Big Bucks". XL Roofing proved to be the company that takes an interest in the "little guy".</p>
                <p>Thanks Chris and crew for a job well done! Pictures on request at</p>
